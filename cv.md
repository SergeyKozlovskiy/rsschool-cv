## About me
I received my first order for layout in 2018. Having completed it, he received a permanent customer and began to actively study the IT world.
Realizing the need for comprehensive training, he completed a powerful web development intensive in 2018.
At the same time, he carried out layout orders. In 2019, he took courses in JS. In 2020 I started practicing in React, but
there were no commercial projects. I came to the conclusion that for further development I need teamwork and a large number of different tasks.

    let str = Object.values ​​(a) .sort (). join ('');
    let str2 = Object.values ​​(b) .sort (). join ('');
